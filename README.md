want to learn how to do some of this black magic?
i will be writing a small tutorial that will hopefully teach you some of the tricks and thought process involved.
the type system is powerful and shouldn't be gatekept!

please note that i will assume you already have a basic understanding of typescript and how it works.
it is highly recommended that you at least know what the following ideas mean:

-   duck/structural typing
-   nominal typing
-   covariance/contravariance/invariance/bivariance
-   supertype/subtype/superset/subset
-   homomorphism
-   finite state machines
-   functional programming
-   soundness
